If you're running your program on your own computer, you can set the redirect URL to https://localhost:8080. This means Reddit will send the login confirmation back to your computer instead of a website.

By doing this, you don’t have to manually enter your client ID and secret key every time—you can log in securely without sharing those details. It’s a simple way to make authentication easier when testing your app locally!
