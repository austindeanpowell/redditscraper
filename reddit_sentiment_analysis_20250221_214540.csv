l94dko4,"co–star is known to fear monger to keep you interested in their app. it is not backed by astrologers, and i believe has gone further down the AI route. 

venus and mercury have both entered cancer, and some days this week noted by astrologers is not the best... but these planets entering cancer will bring forward more emotionally deep conversations. hence co–star fear mongering. i would recommend The Pattern, CHANI, astro-seek, or astro deinst. you can also download the Sol App, which helps with grounding and daily practices. there is a well known astrology app, but it will not give you horoscopes. i can't remember the name, but if you're interested i'll look at finding it again. 

i strongly advise against co–star at all costs.",-0.2702
l94dm0s,Not accurate. Didn’t get my birth chart house placements correct so I stopped trusting it,0.1248
l94w9re,Costar is trash and not worth having and looking at,-0.1695
m5g273l,I know this was posted a while ago but I'm sorry to hear about your experience with it. I went through a really tough year and Co-Star honestly made my anxiety much worse. I've found the daily updates to be really negative and condescending as well. I decided to delete the app after I had a horrible week and I checked the app only to have the words 'Fail Better' thrown in my face. I highly recommend deleting that trashy app.,-0.8919
l96uan5,"Delete costar. Like get it off your phone. 


First of all, the creator is sketchy at best, unethical at worst. She’s admitted live on The Astrology Podcast to sending out vague and ominous sounding horoscopes to “troll people”, even though it’s really not even her— it’s straight up AI, which has no business being used in astrology. It can’t and won’t ever work. It’s the same BS horoscopes for months or even years at a time. 

As a side note… Astrology and OCD aren’t the best together. It can send you into a spiral, so it might be best to take a break from all the transits, horoscope videos, anything predictive.",0.7184
lyv4t70,"Costar is actually really accurate for me, I didn’t use the app for a week and then me and my boyfriend broke up and the glance of the day said “ let go of old relationship that don’t serve you anymore” and I thought I was a coensedence but I read more and it gave info on exactly what happen between us. As I started using it more it was more and more accurate. I always thought the app wasent that serious but it started to shock me how accurate it was day to day",-0.6956

l96xd97,"I had deleted it for a while because I was obsessive over it but my boyfriend likes the app so he said I should download it so we could add each other. 😭 It can be hard for me to explain my OCD to people who don’t have it, and he just doesn’t get what I meant over the app being bad for me. But now I have anxiety over deleting it, because my OCD makes me think that deleting it is avoiding the truth or whatever… A very shitty mental illness. 🥲",-0.9391
m4ymcbn,Interesting. I keep asking it about any chances that a flame and I will reconcile and it gives mixed answers. Happy to know you're luckier than I ever will be though! Congrats! :),0.9523
m83vcls,"I have a similar experience and also can relate to others anxieties and ocd triggers from the app, however sometimes following the advice/symbolism works in my favor ♡ do whats right for you no matter what, your stars will always be there app or not.",0.0

l9718mz,"I know :( My OCD used to be a lot worse, the thoughts aren’t so “sticky” anymore so it’s not as debilitating as it used to be. But yeah, trying to explain why an app is hurtful to your mental health will make no sense to someone who doesn’t understand OCD, usually. Try not to worry though, that “truth” you’re worried about is just a bunch of 1s and 0s strung together to generate *just enough* fear or intrigue to keep users coming back for more.",-0.9116
